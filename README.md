This repo containts my entry for Imperial create lab's [summerdatachallenge](http://summerdatachallenge.com). The challenge was to apply data science techniques to one or more of their supplied datasets. I chose **London house prices**, listings for all house sales within 100 km of the City of London from 2009 up to 2014.

A short written report can be found under `[report/sdc_report.pdf](report/sdc_report.pdf)` and there's an accompanying site at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea).

## How to run

The competition data is **not** included in this repository due to its terms of use. Therefore to run these scripts, place the file `Houseprice_2009_100km_London.csv` (137 MB) in directory `houseprices/` â€” then each Rscript can be run as standalone using: `Rscript <scriptname>`
