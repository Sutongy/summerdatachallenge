\section*{Overview} 

I analysed the {\bf London house prices} dataset is several innovative
ways. Firstly \emph{fractal context} shows how house sales within an
arbitrary area relate to those if neighbouring districs, up and down
the postcode hierarchy. Secondly, I fit \emph{ARIMA models} to
forecast an area's price trend into the future, with an eye to
suggesting profitable investments. Finally, these and other metrics
were combined into an \emph{investment grade} for a given postcode
area. Combined this set of analyses forms the basis of \logo, a
product aimed at ``democratising real estate investment'', offering
individuals and businesses quantitative real estate insights for
data-driven investment decisions.

A full report with additional visualisations is online at {\bf
  \href{http://blm.io/datarea}{blm.io/datarea} }and scripts to
reproduce all analyses are available from {\bf
  \href{http://github.com/blmoore/summerdatachallenge}{github.com/blmoore/summerdatachallenge}}.

\section*{Analyses}

When considering a property in a given area, you may ask a realtor
questions like: how do prices here compare to surrounding postcodes?
How have prices increased over time? And how have prices changed over
time? A real estate professional can give an opinion based on their
own limited sample size, but with a large dataset we can address these
questions quantitatively and visualise the results.

\subsection*{Fractal context}

\setlength{\intextsep}{0em}
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.5\textwidth}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{Figures/fractal.png}
\vspace{.5em}
\caption{ Fractal context of postcode SW18 4HU in Wandsworth, South London.}
\end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

Letting and sales sites may currently list some recent sales, but it's
not currently possible to see a quantitative overview of property
prices in a region, within the context of its sector, district and
postcode.

These questions can be answered with a clear and intuitive data
visualisation of price distributions in the postcode hierarchy --- we
call this the fractal context of a property price (Figure 1).

A specific postcode or area can be marked within its distribution,
giving a clear view of a properties relative pricing which cannot be
gleaned just by browsing recent sales. The example view (Figure 1)
combines ranked violin density plots and a geo-heatmap for a clear,
intuitive view of a locations price context.

\subsection*{ARIMA modelling}

Given a time series of housing prices, it's of interest to investors
to speculate on potential investment returns for a given property
area. This can be done through time series analysis using the
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (Figure 2). The
model fitting procedure included regularisation that allowed a $drift$
term to model non-stationary trends, as well as coefficients capturing
periodicity or seasonal effects. Potential investment returns could be
optimised by selecting areas with
maximal growth projections. \\

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Investment grading}

Combining growth forecasts and other derived metrics from this
dataset allow an approximate investment grading, relative to other
postcodes within the area covered by this dataset. This intuitive
output metric can help prioritise areas ripe for property investment.

As an example, Figure 3 shows the top 5 best-ranked postcode sectors
in which to invest, according to their 12-month price growth forecast
and historical annualised volatility --- thus combining the empirical
data with theoretical model outputs. These include South London
suburbs of Upper Tooting and Morden, Walthamstow, as well as Brockley,
whose train station within SE4 1 was linked with the London overground network in 2010.\\

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Figures/t5.pdf}
\caption{Top 5 property investment sectors by projected returns and historical volatility.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The rankings used in Figure 3 made use of the $drift$ parameter of
ARIMA models, combined with statistical volatility over the five year
house prices dataset. Both parameters were converted to quantiles and
weighted equally, with those sectors with the largest projected growth
and lowest historical volatility receive the highest investment grade.\textsuperscript{$\star$}

\section*{Value generation}

\subsection*{Socio-economic value}

\subsection*{Initial product}
\logo \hspace{.1em} would first be released as both a web service and
associated apps for mobiles and tablets. These would offer limited
analysis and visualisation for free, with user analytics and feedback
helping to validate the business model.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.4\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.39\textwidth]{Figures/mockup.png}
\caption{ iOS app mock-up.}
\end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

A small data science team will gradually expand the range of analyses
offered, integrating novel public and privately-acquired datasets and
release them under a rolling subscription model, aimed at private
landlords and property speculators, as well as professional real
estate investment trusts (REITs). Significant revenue could be
generated through tailored partnerships with funds and high net-worth
individuals.

Additionally the business could pivot to an analytics provider for
existing letting and sales sites, offering unique data insights
indirectly to the consumer market, or as independent fund consultants
for the financial services. Having produced a first-to-market
innovative product positions \logo \hspace{.1em} to succeed as a
provider of advanced real estate investment analytics. \\
